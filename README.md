AmtProjects
===========

Web framework for pluggable MTurk experiments

This is very much code in development.  The intent is not so much to provide an easy way to interface with the AMT API (there are numerous libraries for that, including the the aws java api that this framework depends upon), so much as to provide a convenient way for organizing multiple AMT Tasks.

Features to be developed as I need them. :-)
